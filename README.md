# Obsidian Theme Modern Dark

Theme for the markdown editor [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md).
Intended to roughly match the style of Adwaita and VSCode in dark mode.

Only dark mode is supported!

## Inspired by

The icon font (used for the folder and file icons) is copied from the [Faded Theme by Joshua Kasap](https://github.com/JoshKasap/Obsidian-Faded-Theme) which seams to be based on the [ITS Theme by SlRvb](https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme).
